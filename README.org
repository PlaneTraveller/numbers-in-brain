** Task Stack
- [ ] do classification task on individual numbers (?) (whole brain data)
- [X] pair fmri response with task onset info, see it move
- [X] data-wrangling
- [X] download dataset
- [X] create dev env using flake, =shell.nix=
- [X] pyenv
- [X] ROI extraction
- [ ] begin group analysis (classifiers) (prereqs?)
- [ ] ask about design mat choice
- [ ] build & clarify abstraction of design matrices (+clean up notebook format)
- [ ] train level 1 glm using ~trial_type~ as design mat
- [ ] add smoothing
- [X] add in noise covariates (head motion corr)
- [X] add responses from the same number together, print the 10 numbers
- [X] use task to index data
- [X] write indexing wheels acc. pipeline
- [X] try preliminary processing task to know the interfaces
- [X] what group level to do? use GPT's answer
- [X] figure out the statistical tools needed to test the hypothesis
- [X] learn GLM to translate the topic into mathematical languages
- [X] organize possible analysis for asking
- [X] find an arbitrary analysis to do
- [X] train trial wise glm, use that as feature, linear classifier
- [X] migrate to pure py env.
- [X] find a proper material for the depth of learning
- [X] what statistical tests do I need to run? form a question for PI
- [X] Understand the basics (read dartbrain)
- [X] get to know the single-subject models (recursive reading) [[https://dartbrains.org/content/Group_Analysis.html][Group Analysis]]
- [X] what analysis will I run? (GLM Decoding model, binary classification model)
- [X] what is the hypothesis? (different number groups are represented in different brain regions) (It is possible to decode number from trials)
- [X] find way to obtain feedback like nix! (possible sol: write helper functions, classes: try collect!)
- [X] survey the interfaces/existing wheels
- [X] how to do the data processing
- [X] figure out what data processing?
- [X] what to search (wheels)
- [X] read docs and tutorial for popular packages (nilearn, pandas, numpy, torch?)
- [X] find an example (huze)
- [X] find an example to follow (NMA)
- [X] go thru the tutorial
- [X] explore fmriprep output structure
- [X] bids standard
- [X] use derivative
- [X] rebuild structure
- [X] use fmriprep to normalize
- [X] see a brain, any brain
- [X] load it in!
- [X] read py mri course
- [X] determine if it's preprocessed
- [X] understand mask
- [X] determine the structure of functional and structural data
- [X] load it in and print it out
- [X] get familiar with bids accessing
- [X] grasp data structure, content, dimensions
- [X] how is it processed?

* Q
- Should I do neural decoding on number representations.
- What statistical model should I use? Binary or mlp level
- ~1000 trials. enough?
- Data in entire timeseries or choose one volumn



* Goals
- representation difference of different algebraic tasks between LLMs and humans
- number representations
- other stuff with the existing data (DD&TA?)
-

* Analysis
** 1.
- single subject first-level model
- model each subject: predict activation in single voxel over scanning session
- different brain regions in processing aspects (regressors that model different brain processes)
