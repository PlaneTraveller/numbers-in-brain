* Basic Idea
exploring "concept space" for the human brain.
- insight: wildly multimodal models can actually outperform tasks fine-tuned to individual tasks. is it possible that the "concept space" is exactly intelligence?
- examine "concept space" representations in same person in different "mindsets"
