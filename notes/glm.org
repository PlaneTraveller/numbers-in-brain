- ANCOVA
- multiple regression
- idea: represent dependent variable as lc of independent variables + error
#+begin_export latex
Y = X \times B + E

- Y is dependent (vector of observations)
- X: mat of independent variables (design mat)
- e.g. Y: observed fMRI, X: modeled responses based on design (basically conditions?)
- GLM: infer activation patterns associated with conditions (different numbers)
- GLM: input number, get brain response
- can evaluate significance of independent variables' effects: how corelated numbers seen is to brain response
- identify brain regions that show consistent activation pattern across participants
