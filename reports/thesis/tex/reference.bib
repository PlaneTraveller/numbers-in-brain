abstract = {Abstract Functional neuroimaging serves as a tool to better understand the cerebral correlates of atypical behaviors, such as learning difficulties. While significant advances have been made in characterizing the neural correlates of reading difficulties (developmental dyslexia), comparatively little is known about the neurobiological correlates of mathematical learning difficulties, such as developmental dyscalculia (DD). Furthermore, the available neuroimaging studies of DD are characterized by small sample sizes and variable inclusion criteria, which make it problematic to compare across studies. In addition, studies to date have focused on identifying single deficits in neuronal processing among children with DD (e.g., mental arithmetic), rather than probing differences in brain function across different processing domains that are known to be affected in children with DD. Here, we seek to address the limitations of prior investigations. Specifically, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to probe brain differences between children with and without persistent DD; 68 children (8-10 years old, 30 with DD) participated in an fMRI study designed to investigate group differences in the functional neuroanatomy associated with commonly reported behavioral deficits in children with DD: basic number processing, mental arithmetic and visuo-spatial working memory (VSWM). Behavioral data revealed that children with DD were less accurate than their typically achieving (TA) peers for the basic number processing and arithmetic tasks. No behavioral differences were found for the tasks measuring VSWM. A pre-registered, whole-brain, voxelwise univariate analysis of the fMRI data from the entire sample of children (DD and TA) revealed areas commonly associated with the three tasks (basic number processing, mental arithmetic, and VSWM). However, the examination of differences in brain activation between children with and without DD revealed no consistent group differences in brain activation. In view of these null results, we ran exploratory, Bayesian analyses on the data to quantify the amount of evidence for no group differences. This analysis provides supporting evidence for no group differences across all three tasks. We present the largest fMRI study comparing children with and without persistent DD to date. We found no group differences in brain activation using univariate, frequentist analyses. Moreover, Bayesian analyses revealed evidence for the null hypothesis of no group differences. These findings contradict previous literature and reveal the need to investigate the neural basis of DD using multivariate and network-based approaches to brain imaging.},

abstract = {This paper provides a tutorial introduction to numerical cognition, with a review of essential findings and current points of debate. A tacit hypothesis in cognitive arithmetic is that numerical abilities derive from human linguistic competence. One aim of this special issue is to confront this hypothesis with current knowledge of number representations in animals, infants, normal and gifted adults, and brain-lesioned patients. First, the historical evolution of number notations is presented, together with the mental processes for calculating and transcoding from one notation to another. While these domains are well described by formal symbol-processing models, this paper argues that such is not the case for two other domains of numerical competence: quantification and approximation. The evidence for counting, subitizing and numerosity estimation in infants, children, adults and animals is critically examined. Data are also presented which suggest a specialization for processing approximate numerical quantities in animals and humans. A synthesis of these findings is proposed in the form of a triple-code model, which assumes that numbers are mentally manipulated in an arabic, verbal or analogical magnitude code depending on the requested mental operation. Only the analogical magnitude representation seems available to animals and preverbal infants.}

In the case of numbers, it was previously suggested that this process is grounded on two early pre-verbal systems for numerical quantification: the approximate number system (ANS or ‘analogue magnitude’), and the object tracking system (OTS or ‘parallel individuation’), which children are equipped with before symbolic learning. Each system is based on dedicated neural circuits, characterized by specific computational limits, and each undergoes a separate developmental trajectory. Here, I review the available cognitive and neuroscientific data and argue that the available evidence is more consistent with a crucial role for the ANS, rather than for the OTS, in the acquisition of abstract numerical concepts that are uniquely human.}

    abstract = {Adult humans, infants, pre-school children, and non-human animals appear to share a system of approximate numerical processing for non-symbolic stimuli such as arrays of dots or sequences of tones. Behavioral studies of adult humans implicate a link between these non-symbolic numerical abilities and symbolic numerical processing (e.g., similar distance effects in accuracy and reaction-time for arrays of dots and Arabic numerals). However, neuroimaging studies have remained inconclusive on the neural basis of this link. The intraparietal sulcus (IPS) is known to respond selectively to symbolic numerical stimuli such as Arabic numerals. Recent studies, however, have arrived at conflicting conclusions regarding the role of the IPS in processing non-symbolic, numerosity arrays in adulthood, and very little is known about the brain basis of numerical processing early in development. Addressing the question of whether there is an early-developing neural basis for abstract numerical processing is essential for understanding the cognitive origins of our uniquely human capacity for math and science. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at 4-Tesla and an event-related fMRI adaptation paradigm, we found that adults showed a greater IPS response to visual arrays that deviated from standard stimuli in their number of elements, than to stimuli that deviated in local element shape. These results support previous claims that there is a neurophysiological link between non-symbolic and symbolic numerical processing in adulthood. In parallel, we tested 4-y-old children with the same fMRI adaptation paradigm as adults to determine whether the neural locus of non-symbolic numerical activity in adults shows continuity in function over development. We found that the IPS responded to numerical deviants similarly in 4-y-old children and adults. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that the neural locus of adult numerical cognition takes form early in development, prior to sophisticated symbolic numerical experience. More broadly, this is also, to our knowledge, the first cognitive fMRI study to test healthy children as young as 4 y, providing new insights into the neurophysiology of human cognitive development.},

  abstract = "Neural representations of approximate numerical value, or

              in monkeys and humans, including children. Using functional
              magnetic resonance imaging, we show that children as young as 3-4
              years old exhibit neural tuning to cardinal numerosities in the
              IPS and that their neural responses are accounted for by a model
              of numerosity coding that has been used to explain neural
              responses in the adult IPS. We also found that the sensitivity of
              children's neural tuning to number in the right IPS was
              comparable to their numerical discrimination sensitivity observed
              behaviorally, outside of the scanner. Children's neural tuning
              curves in the right IPS were significantly sharper than in the
              left IPS, indicating that numerical representations are more
              precise and mature more rapidly in the right hemisphere than in
              the left. Further, we show that children's perceptual sensitivity
              to numerosity can be predicted by the development of their neural
              sensitivity to numerosity. This research provides novel evidence
              of developmental continuity in the neural code underlying
              numerical representation and demonstrates that children's neural

              those effects could be explained by patterns of neural activity
              that do not represent neural tuning to numerosity. These data
              provide the first robust evidence that from as early as 3-4 years
              of age there is developmental continuity in how the intraparietal
              sulcus represents the values of numerosities. Moreover, the study

We used both psychophysics and neuroimaging to examine whether a similar neural coding scheme is present in humans. When participants viewed sets of items with a variable number, the bilateral intraparietal sulci responded selectively to number change. Functionally, the shape of this response indicates that humans, like other animal species, encode approximate number on a compressed internal scale. Anatomically, the intraparietal site coding for number in humans is compatible with that observed in macaque monkeys. Our results therefore suggest an evolutionary basis for human elementary arithmetic.}

               ability to rapidly enumerate small (1-4) numerosities is
               referred to as ``subitizing'' and is thought to be qualitatively
               different from large numerosity processing. Functional
               neuro-imaging studies have attempted to dissociate neural
               correlates of small and large number processing by contrasting
               subitizing with counting of numerosities just outside the

               studied the neural correlates of visual enumeration under

               Relatively intact subitizing under low attentional load compared
               to impaired subitizing under high attentional load was
               associated with an increase in BOLD signal in the right

               modulated response in the rTPJ was specific to small set sizes
               (up to 3 items) and did not occur at larger set sizes (5-7

               involves part of the fronto-parietal network for stimulus-driven
               attention providing neural evidence against preattentive
               subitizing. (2) Activity in rTPJ is set-size modulated. Together

               of numerical values, including a symbolic number system that
               allows them to conceive of numerical information as Arabic
               numerals or number words. Functional brain imaging studies of
               adults report that activity in bilateral regions of the
               intraparietal sulcus (IPS) represents a key neural correlate of
               numerical cognition. Developmental neuroimaging studies indicate
               that the right IPS develops its number-related neural response
               profile more rapidly than the left IPS during early childhood.
               One prediction that can be derived from previous findings is
               that there is longitudinal continuity in the number-related
               neural responses of the right IPS over development while the
               development of the left IPS depends on the acquisition of
               numerical skills. We tested this hypothesis using fMRI in a
               longitudinal design with children ages 4 to 9. We found that
               neural responses in the right IPS are correlated over a 1-2-year
               period in young children whereas left IPS responses change
               systematically as a function of children's numerical
               discrimination acuity. The data are consistent with the
               hypothesis that functional properties of the right IPS in
               numerical processing are stable over early childhood whereas the
               functions of the left IPS are dynamically modulated by the
               development of numerical skills.",

               children. Using fMRI, brain activation was measured in 10 third-
               and 10 sixth-grade school children and 20 adults during trials
               of symbolic approximate (AP) and exact (EX) calculation, as well
               as non-symbolic magnitude comparison (MC) of objects. Children
               activated similar networks like adults, denoting an availability
               and a similar spatial extent of specified networks as early as
               third grade. However, brain areas related to number processing
               become further specialized with schooling. Children showed
               weaker activation in the intraparietal sulcus during all three
               tasks, in the left inferior frontal gyrus during EX and in
               occipital areas during MC. In contrast, activation in the
               anterior cingulate gyrus, a region associated with attentional
               effort and working memory load, was enhanced in children.
               Moreover, children revealed reduced or absent deactivation of
               regions involved in the so-called default network during
               symbolic calculation, suggesting a rather general developmental
               effect. No difference in brain activation patterns between AP
               and EX was found. Behavioral results indicated major differences
               between children and adults in AP and EX, but not in MC.
               Reaction time and accuracy rate were not correlated to brain
               activation in regions showing developmental changes suggesting
               rather effects of development than performance differences
               between children and adults. In conclusion, increasing expertise
               with age may lead to more automated processing of mental
               arithmetic, which is reflected by improved performance and by

We tested the hypothesis that this pattern emerges because an understanding of cardinal value jump starts children’s learning of the relations among numerals. Across two years of preschool, the cardinal knowledge of 179 children (85 boys) was assessed four times, as was their understanding of the relative quantity of Arabic numerals and competence at discriminating nonsymbolic quantities. Children were more accurate on nonsymbolic than numeral comparisons before they understood cardinality, but showed more rapid growth for numeral than nonsymbolic comparisons once they understood cardinality. Moreover, and with the possible exception of very small numerals (<5), before they understood cardinality children were no better than chance in their numeral comparisons, but greatly exceeded chance once they understood cardinality. These patterns were independent of the age at which children became cardinal principle knowers and independent of intelligence, executive function, and preliteracy skills. More broadly, the results provide a developmental bridge between cardinal knowledge and school-entry number knowledge.}

abstract = {Symbolic and non-symbolic magnitude representations, measured by digit or dot comparison tasks, are assumed to underlie the development of arithmetic skills. The comparison distance effect (CDE) has been suggested as a hallmark of the preciseness of mental magnitude representations. It implies that two magnitudes are harder to discriminate when the numerical distance between them is small, and may therefore differ in children with mathematical difficulties (MD), i.e. low mathematical achievement or dyscalculia. However, empirical findings on the CDE in children with MD are heterogeneous, and only few studies assess both symbolic and non-symbolic skills. This meta-analysis therefore integrates 44 symbolic and 48 non-symbolic response time (RT) outcomes reported in nineteen studies (N=1630 subjects, aged 6–14 years). Independent of age, children with MD show significantly longer mean RTs than typically achieving controls, particularly on symbolic (Hedges’ g=0.75; 95% CI [0.51; 0.99]), but to a significantly lower extent also on non-symbolic (g=0.24; 95% CI [0.13; 0.36]) tasks. However, no group differences were found for the CDE. Extending recent work, these meta-analytical findings on children with MD corroborate the diagnostic importance of magnitude comparison speed in symbolic tasks. By contrast, the validity of CDE measures in assessing MD is questioned.}

At present, there are only a handful of screening tools to identify children that might be at risk of developing DD. The present study evaluated the classification accuracy of one such tool: The Numeracy Screener, a 2-min test of symbolic (Arabic numerals) and nonsymbolic (dot arrays) discrimination ability. A sample of 222 children who demonstrated persistent deficits (n = 55), inconsistent deficits (n = 51), or typical performance (n = 116) on standardized tests of math achievement over multiple observations was tested. The Numeracy Screener correctly classified children in all three groups. Notably, the symbolic condition has greater sensitivity in discriminating children with persistent DD from the other two groups. Screening tools that assess early numeracy skills may be promising for identifying children at risk for developing severe mathematical difficulties.},

  abstract  = "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides a unique
               view of the working human mind. The blood-oxygen-level-dependent
               (BOLD) signal, detected in fMRI, reflects changes in
               deoxyhemoglobin driven by localized changes in brain blood flow
               and blood oxygenation, which are coupled to underlying neuronal
               activity by a process termed neurovascular coupling. Over the
               past 10 years, a range of cellular mechanisms, including
               astrocytes, pericytes, and interneurons, have been proposed to
               play a role in functional neurovascular coupling. However, the
               field remains conflicted over the relative importance of each
               process, while key spatiotemporal features of BOLD response
               remain unexplained. Here, we review current candidate
               neurovascular coupling mechanisms and propose that previously
               overlooked involvement of the vascular endothelium may provide a
               more complete picture of how blood flow is controlled in the
               brain. We also explore the possibility and consequences of
               conditions in which neurovascular coupling may be altered,
               including during postnatal development, pathological states, and
               aging, noting relevance to both stimulus-evoked and
               resting-state fMRI studies.",

abstract = {The triple code model of numerical cognition (TCM) details the neurocognitive mechanisms associated with perceiving and manipulating numerical information in exact symbolic (Arabic digits and number words) and approximate nonsymbolic numerical magnitude (e.g., dot arrays) representation codes. The current study provides a first empirical fMRI-based investigation into neurodevelopmental differences in 30 healthy children’s and 44 healthy adults’ recruitment of neural correlates associated with the Arabic digit, number word, and nonsymbolic magnitude codes. Differences between the two groups were found in cingulate regions commonly associated with domain-general aspects of cognitive control, as opposed to neural correlates of number processing per se. A primary developmental difference was identified in verbal number discrimination, where only adults recruited left-lateralized perisylvian language areas in accordance with the TCM. We therefore call for a revision of the verbal code and a formulation of separate child and adult-specific neurocognitive mechanisms associated with the discrimination of number words. Although further research is necessary, results indicate that numerical discrimination abilities in middle-school-aged children operate close to adult-level maturity. Neurodevelopmental differences may be more apparent in younger children, or on the level of functional network dynamics as opposed to a shift in recruited neural substrates.}
